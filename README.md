## Magicoder 

**ðŸŽ©Magicoder is a model family empowered by ðŸª„OSS-Instruct, a novel approach to enlightening LLMs with open-source code snippets for generating low-bias and high-quality instruction data for code.**


**ðŸª„OSS-Instruct mitigates the inherent bias of the LLM-synthesized instruction data by empowering them with a wealth of open-source references to produce more diverse, realistic, and controllable data.**
